    <h2>What is Focusly?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Focusly</strong> lets you move around complex, data-heavy UIs using only the keyboard.
      Use <strong>Alt + Arrow Keys</strong> to move between interactive cells, and press
      <strong>Enter</strong> to trigger the contextual action for that panel.

    <h2>Keyboard Navigation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alt + ↑ / ↓ / ← / →</strong> – Move between fields</li>
      <li><strong>Home / End</strong> – Jump to first / last column in the current row</li>
      <li><strong>Page Up / Page Down</strong> – Jump to first / last row</li>
      <li><strong>Enter</strong> – Run the panel's action (Save / Confirm)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Below are two independent panels. Notice how <strong>Enter</strong> in the first panel
      triggers “Confirm Trades”, and in the second panel it triggers “Save Customer”. Focusly keeps
      those behaviours scoped.

    <h2>Component Toolkit Independant</h2>
    <p>
      Focusly is designed to work seamlessly across all UI component toolkits. In this demo you can
      switch between Vanilla HTML and NG-ZORRO. Toolkit-specific support is implemented as a thin
      extension of the base directive, meaning the core navigation logic stays centralised and clean
      while each UI library only adds a few small, tailored overrides. This keeps behaviour
      consistent, predictable, and incredibly easy to maintain.

    <p>
      <input type="radio" [checked]="toolkit() === 'none'" (click)="toolkit.set('none')" /><label
        >Vanilla HTML</label
      >
      <input
        type="radio"
        [checked]="toolkit() === 'ngzorro'"
        (click)="toolkit.set('ngzorro')"
      /><label>Ng-Zorro</label>
    </p>

  @if (toolkit() === 'ngzorro') {
    <app-ng-zorro></app-ng-zorro>
  } @else {
    <app-vanilla-html></app-vanilla-html>
