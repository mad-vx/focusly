FocuslyShortcutDirective created. This directive leverages the existing Focusly framework to allow definition and c0onfiguration of shotcut keys and associated actions on any UI element. This has replaced the 'subscriber' and 'listener' components previously used to achieve the same purpose. This has significant benefits including a tidier less noisy dom, intuitive configuration and better performance and package footprint.
